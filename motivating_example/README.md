This standalone directory contains the source code to readily reproduce our motivating example.

### Step 1: Setup the Environment
1. Make sure you have uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/
2. (only for the first time) From the root directory of the project: `uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && cd generators && uv run quick_and_dirty_synthcity_test.py`

### Step 2: Execute the Script
1. Starting from the root directory of the project, get inside the `motivating_example/` directory: `cd motivating_example`
2. Run the script using the environment you set up during step 1: `uv run motivating_example.py`

> Depending on your hardware, this script can run for long. When tested on a CPU-only machine, it took around 10 hours to complete

### Step 3: See the Result
Once the execution is completed, you can see the generated plot appearing as a new file in the same directory. The file name should be `impact_plot.png`.

> Note: For convenience, we are uploading several plots with different train and test sizes generated by us during our investigation with the exact same source code. All plots verify our motivation: Different realistic data errors have a different impact across SoTA generators, **even on the exact same dataset**. Equiped with the findings from our study, data practitioners can apply informed cleaning decisions based on their cleaning budget and downstream requirements.
